# AssetManagement
Steps to run the TEST
1. Run the command, npm install to download the node dependencies (node_modules)
2. Run the script from package.json - "start": "react-scripts start", to start the Application
3. Execute the command npx cypress open from terminal to open the cypress test runner and run the test.feature file
For cross browser testing please choose browsers from cypress test runner.

Note:
I have automated Scenario 1 which is adding Assets .
Scenario 2 could not be completed as the Exisiting assets could not be loaded.
